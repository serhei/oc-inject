- README: discuss why gdbserver on CentOS is wanted even with gdb in some containers
  - reason 1: we want to use debuginfo provided outside the container
  - reason 2: we want to use a custom tool that speaks gdbserver protocol, e.g. gdb-strace
- README: add gdb-strace example when ready
- solve solvable limitations described in README
